#ui-resizebox
This makes a resizeable panel, which by default will go in flow, but you
can easily make a docked resizer by using `absolute` positioning. Grab the
element on the `left` or `right` and resize away.

###right
Just put this attribute on, and the resize bar handle will appear to the right.
